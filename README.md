🇮🇳 Java Waving Indian Flag Animation
A beautiful, animated tribute to the Indian flag created with Java Swing. This application first displays its own source code in a classic "Matrix" style, then artistically draws the flag, and finally brings it to life with a gentle waving animation.

✨ Features
This project is built with Java Swing and showcases a multi-phase animation:

💻 Phase 1: Code Reveal

The application starts by displaying its own source code, typing it out line-by-line with a scrolling effect against a black background, reminiscent of classic hacker movie terminals.

🎨 Phase 2: Flag Drawing

Once the code is revealed, the scene transitions. The Indian flag is drawn progressively, point-by-point from left to right, as if a light is revealing it.

🌬️ Phase 3: Waving Animation

After the flag is fully drawn, a gentle, continuous waving effect is applied. The animation is achieved by applying a sine wave distortion, giving the flag a realistic, fluid motion.
